Great! Here’s how you can **upload your portfolio to GitHub** step by step:  

---

## ✅ **1. Create a GitHub Repository**  
1. Go to **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** and log in.  
2. Click on **“+” (New repository)** in the top right.  
3. Name your repository (e.g., `my-portfolio`).  
4. Choose **Public** (so people can view it) or **Private**.  
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README" (we’ll do it manually).  
6. Click **Create repository**.  

---

## ✅ **2. Upload Your Portfolio from Your Local Computer**  

### **(A) If Your Project is NOT Already in Git**  
1. Open **Terminal** (Mac/Linux) or **Git Bash** (Windows).  
2. Navigate to your portfolio folder:  
   ```sh
   cd path/to/your-portfolio
   ```
3. Initialize Git:  
   ```sh
   git init
   ```
4. Add all files:  
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
5. Commit your changes:  
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
6. Link your local folder to the GitHub repository:  
   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-portfolio.git
   ```
7. Push your files to GitHub:  
   ```sh
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

### **(B) If Your Project is Already in Git (Just Add Remote & Push)**  
If your folder already has `.git`, just run:  
```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-portfolio.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## ✅ **3. Deploy Your Portfolio on GitHub Pages (Optional)**  
If your portfolio is an HTML-based website, you can host it for free using **GitHub Pages**:  
1. Go to your **GitHub repository**.  
2. Click **Settings** > Scroll to **"Pages"**.  
3. Under **"Branch"**, select `main` and click **Save**.  
4. Your portfolio will be live at:  
   ```
   https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/my-portfolio/
   ```

### 🎉 **Done! Your Portfolio is Now on GitHub!**

The error **"remote origin already exists"** means that your Git repository already has a remote link set. To fix this, you have two options:

---

## ✅ **Option 1: Check If the Remote URL is Correct**
First, check which remote URL is currently set:  
```sh
git remote -v
```
This will output something like:  
```
origin  https://github.com/some-user/old-repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/some-user/old-repo.git (push)
```

- If it's **incorrect**, update it with:  
  ```sh
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/JasOlean/KSBH.git
  ```
- If it's **correct**, try pushing your code:  
  ```sh
  git push -u origin main
  ```

---

## ✅ **Option 2: Remove and Re-add the Remote**
If you're unsure, remove the old remote and add the correct one again:
```sh
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/JasOlean/KSBH.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 🎯 **Final Check**
1. Run `git remote -v` to confirm the correct GitHub repository is linked.
2. Use `git push -u origin main` to push your portfolio.
3. If authentication is needed, follow GitHub's **Personal Access Token** method instead of a password.
